# SFML C++11 Cat Game

## A Pac Man inspired game built with C++11.

The main purpose of this project was to gain some experience in programming a complex system using C++, and to learn the new C++11 standard.

UML modelling was used. A class diagram, and state machine diagram were developed for this project.

The main skills developed during the coding of this project:

1. System architecture design
2. Real-time system programming
3. C++11 standard practices - smart pointers all the way :)
4. Just general C++ programming

No game engine was used. The only tool used was the [*SFML*](https://www.sfml-dev.org) library. All *subsystems* had to be developed such as a UI system, 2D world generation, game control, and sprite animation subsystems.

**Note:** This project was a side project built during senior level undergraduate courses (not part of the courses - but as a hobby project). It is not complete, as the collision detection systems need work (the cat can walt through walls...)

**Note:** This project was developed at a time where I was not aware of build systems such as CMake. Hence, it is simply an XCode project with C++ source code. SFML 2.0 is required to build the game.

**Why Cats? Because, why not?**
