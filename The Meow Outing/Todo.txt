[-] Collision Detection Improvements
--> Decrease collision detection length between player and enemies.
--> Fix issues with some collision blocks in the world not being detected.

[-] Implement AI
--> Automatic running around of enemies.
--> Chase after player.
--> Able to move away in other direction after collision.

[-] Game Main Menu
--> Implement state stack
--> Implement pausing the game
--> Implement basic main menu

ISSUES:
- Crash when player moves outside bounds (negative x, y) -> Due to the collisionMapData indexing at each frame.
